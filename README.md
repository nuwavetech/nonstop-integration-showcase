# HPE NonStop Integration Showcase

This Integration Showcase demonstrates the powerful integration capabilities of NuWave's **LightWave** solutions for HPE NonStop systems. Using a payment card manager simulation as a demonstration vehicle, this showcase highlights how **LightWave Server™** and **LightWave Client™** enable seamless REST API integration with both HPE NonStop and external services.

## Overview

The showcase illustrates how **LightWave Server™** can REST-enable traditional HPE NonStop applications and services. Through the Payment Card Simulation interface, you can explore various integration points where LightWave products facilitate communication between modern web applications and HPE NonStop server processes.

Key integration features demonstrated include:
- REST-enabling traditional NonStop pathway servers
- Real-time bidirectional data exchange between web clients and HPE NonStop
- External API integration with third-party services
- Secure authentication and transaction processing

## Demonstration Features

The Payment Card Simulation provides a practical context for these integration capabilities. Through the *Payments* view, you can initiate simulated payments transactions and see real-time results, while the *Transactions* view provides a historical record. The *API Request Log* view reveals the underlying REST communication, displaying all requests to and responses from the HPE NonStop.

When enabled, the showcase demonstrates external API integration by using **LightWave Client™** to communicate with public and private cloud services:
- Payment transaction SMS alerts delivered via the [Twilio SMS](https://www.twilio.com) REST API
- Payment notification emails delivered via the [SendGrid Email](https://www.sendgrid.com) REST API
