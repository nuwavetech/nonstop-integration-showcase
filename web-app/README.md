# LightWave NSIS Payment Card Simulation Web Application
The NSIS Payment Card Simulation Web Application is a Single Page Application (SPA) that implements the User Interface for the Payment Card Simulation. The entire application is implemented in a handful of HTML, Javascript, CSS, and image files. The files can be deployed to any HTTP server capable of hosting static content.

The application must be accessed from an HTTP server. <em>It will not work by simply opening the files in a browser from the desktop filesystem.</em> There are a number of solutions available that will allow you to deploy the application to a web server, for example:
+ Deploy to a local copy of [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/) or [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/) server.
+ Deploy to an AWS S3 bucket configured for [static web site hosting](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/WebsiteHosting.html).
+ If using Visual Studio Code, use the [Live Server extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer).
+ If using Node.js, use the [http-server package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server).

Any HTTP server capable of hosting static pages is sufficient. All of the files in the [app](app) folder should be deployed to the HTTP server.

### Configuration
The LightWave Server service port must be configured. Edit the settings.json file to configure the host name and service port of your LightWave Server instance.

```javascript
{
  "baseUrl": "http://your-host:your-service-port"
}
```
Note that the port specified should be the service port on which the Payment Card Simulation service is deployed, not the the Server Console port. After configuring the port, you may need to refresh your browser in order for the change to take effect.
